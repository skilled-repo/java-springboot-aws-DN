A record class declares the following members automatically:

For each component in the header, the following two members:

A private final field with the same name and declared type as the record component. 
This field is sometimes referred to as a component field.

A public accessor method with the same name and type of the component;

A canonical constructor whose signature is the same as the header. 
This constructor assigns each argument from the new expression that instantiates the record 
class to the corresponding component field.

Implementations of the equals and hashCode methods, which specify that two record 
classes are equal if they are of the same type and contain 
equal component values.

An implementation of the toString method that includes the string representation of all 
the record class's components, with their names.

As record classes are just special kinds of classes, you create a record object 
(an instance of a record class) with the new keyword
